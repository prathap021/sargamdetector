Sargam Detector üéµ 

A Python-based application that detects Sargam (musical notes) from audio files or real-time input. Ideal for Indian classical music enthusiasts and learners who want to analyze musical patterns.
Features

    üé∂ Detect Notes: Recognizes and displays musical notes (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni).
    üéôÔ∏è Real-time Analysis: Detect notes from live audio input using a microphone.
    ‚ö° Fast and Accurate: Optimized algorithms for quick and precise detection.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed. The following libraries are required:

    numpy
    librosa
    matplotlib
    pyaudio (for real-time audio analysis)

To install the dependencies, run:

pip install numpy librosa matplotlib pyaudio

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/prathap021/sargamdetector

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sargam-detector

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Start real-time detection with a microphone:

python app.py

How It Works

    Audio Processing: Uses the librosa library to extract audio features like pitch and frequency.
    Note Mapping: Converts frequencies into corresponding Sargam notes based on predefined scales.
    Real-time Processing: Captures audio from the microphone and processes it in chunks for continuous detection.
